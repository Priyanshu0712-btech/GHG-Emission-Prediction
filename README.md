# 🌍 GHG Emission Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting and analyzing **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions** using supply chain emission data collected across different industries and commodities from **2010 to 2017**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **File:** `SupplyChainEmisionFactorsForIndustriesCommodities.xlsx`
- **Source:** Provided dataset from classroom or public sources
- **Contents:** Emission factors for both **industries** and **commodities** across multiple years

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Import and preprocess a large Excel-based dataset
- Handle missing data and convert inconsistent units
- Encode categorical features and normalize numeric values
- Visualize emission trends across years and sectors
- Lay the foundation for prediction in future phases

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- sklearn (for future modeling)

## 🧪 What We Did in Week 1

1. **Imported & Merged** all yearly sheets (Commodity + Industry)
2. **Cleaned Columns** and renamed for consistency
3. **Handled Missing Values**
4. **Converted Units** and created a unified Emission Factor
5. **Encoded Categorical Variables**
6. **Scaled Numerical Features**
